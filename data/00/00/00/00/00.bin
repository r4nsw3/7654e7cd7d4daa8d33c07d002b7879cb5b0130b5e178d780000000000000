  |   Travel back in time to change fate itself, in this beautifully        |
  |   crafted story-driven adventure, inspired by classic 90s               |
  |   action-platformers.                                                   |

  |   With her family murdered in front of her and the ancient              |
  |   Timespinner device destroyed, Lunais is suddenly transported into     |
  |   an unknown world, stranded with seemingly no hope of return. Using    |
  |   her power to control time, Lunais vows to take her revenge on the     |
  |   evil Lachiem Empire, but sometimes the course of history isn't        |
  |   quite as black and white as it seems...                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Explore a vast, connected world with beautifully drawn and detailed   |
  |   pixel art environments. Traverse between the barren present and       |
  |   luscious past of Lachiem, collecting elemental magic orbs and         |
  |   combining their power to destroy enemies with blades and spells.      |
  |   Befriend mysterious creatures called Familiars, such as the           |
  |   adorable dream dragon Meyef, and train them to aid you in battle.     |
  |   Test your skills and timing with intense boss battles, and you        |
  |   venture forth to take on the Emperor himself!                         |
